Functions realized:
    - login with username and password
    - add, delete save goals and show the list with SQLite database
    - add, delete search incomes and expenses and show the list with SQLite database
    - GET request by API

Functions unrealized (future work):
    - Get the progress after calculation (it seems that in one activity, in onCreate(), you can only call content only once in a DBhelper() or a Volley.newRequestQueue()  )
